Make sure to run the Shortcut to the application, you could also go into the files but I'd recommend just running the shortcut!


This project was originally made to be a Text Based Adventure game for my college, but I decided to do more and finish it as a whole project instead!

Mythrill's Legacy is a Souls-like RPG game that is also TextBased played via the Console Application using .NET
(Future plans are to make it in 3D as well)
